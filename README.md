# FourierTransformResearch
- Using python to manipulate a series of variables in order to make learning more about Fourier Transforms
- Used Excel Previously, was too bulky and laggy to keep up with the intense calculations.

# Prerequisites
- Have Python 3.9.0 or higher installed
- Downnload packets matplotlib and numpy using pip3

# How to Install and Run
- Go to https://github.com/joyfulrohan14/FourierTransformResearch and hit the download code green button
- Download the zip file and extract the contents 
- From the command prompt/terminal naviagte to the folder where you have stored the zip file
- now type python FinalFourierGraph.py
- and now there should be two windows running one should be dashboard and the other one should be a series of graphs 
- split your window and have the dashboard on one side and the graphs on the other side and then you will be ready to experiment 

# Dashboard Explanation
- ?? ask professors if want me to explain, or leave for them
